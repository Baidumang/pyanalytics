#What is Clustering
Clustering is the process of dividing the entire data into groups (also known as clusters) based on the patterns in the data.

How to do Clustering
What are the various ways of doing clustering

#%%%
#Hierarchical Clustering
#Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering
We assign each point to an individual cluster in this technique. Suppose there are 4 data points. We will assign each of these points to a cluster and hence will have 4 clusters in the beginning: multiple clusters
Then, at each iteration, we merge the closest pair of clusters and repeat this step until only a single cluster is left: agglomerative clustering
We are merging (or adding) the clusters at each step, right? Hence, this type of clustering is also known as additive hierarchical clustering.

#Divisive Hierarchical Clustering :Divisive hierarchical clustering works in the opposite way. Instead of starting with n clusters (in case of n observations), we start with a single cluster and assign all the points to that cluster.
So, it doesnâ€™t matter if we have 10 or 1000 data points. All these points will belong to the same cluster at the beginning: single cluster
Now, at each iteration, we split the farthest point in the cluster and repeat this process until each cluster only contains a single point: multiple clusters
We are splitting (or dividing) the clusters at each step, hence the name divisive hierarchical clustering.
#--------
Agglomerative Clustering is widely used in the industry and that will be the focus in this article. Divisive hierarchical clustering will be a piece of cake once we have a handle on the agglomerative type.
