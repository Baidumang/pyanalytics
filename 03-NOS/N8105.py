##Define Hypothesis
#PC1: identify the objective of the analysis
#PC2 : evaluate the dataset to determine a suitable approach
#PC3: identify suitable libraries, packages, frameworks, applications to address the objective
##Apply and Optimise Model
#PC4: select suitable algorithmic models from available statistical analysis softwares, packages, libraries or tools
#PC5: apply the model for various use cases and scenarios such as vision, text recognition, image recognition, natural language processing etc
#PC6: optimize selected algorithmic models to resolve any shortcomings or defects
#PC7: iterate the model in consultation with relevant stakeholders till the desired performance or quality of output is achieved
#PC8: validate the models implemented using appropriate tools and processes
#PC9: create documentation on applied algorithmic models for future references and versioning
