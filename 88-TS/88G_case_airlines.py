#The general steps to implement an ARIMA model are â€“
#
#Load the data: The first step for model building is of course to load the dataset
#Preprocessing: Depending on the dataset, the steps of preprocessing will be defined. This will include creating timestamps, converting the dtype of date/time column, making the series univariate, etc.
#Make series stationary: In order to satisfy the assumption, it is necessary to make the series stationary. This would include checking the stationarity of the series and performing required transformations
#Determine d value: For making the series stationary, the number of times the difference operation was performed will be taken as the d value
#Create ACF and PACF plots: This is the most important step in ARIMA implementation. ACF PACF plots are used to determine the input parameters for our ARIMA model
#Determine the p and q values: Read the values of p and q from the plots in the previous step
#Fit ARIMA model: Using the processed data and parameter values we calculated from the previous steps, fit the ARIMA model
#Predict values on validation set: Predict the future values
#Calculate RMSE: To check the performance of the model, check the RMSE value using the predictions and actual values on the validation set

#load the data
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DUanalytics/datasets/master/csv/airline.csv'
data = pd.read_csv('data/airline.csv')
data
#divide into train and validation set
train = data[:int(0.7*(len(data)))]
valid = data[int(0.7*(len(data))):]
train.shape, valid.shape

#preprocessing (since arima takes univariate series as input)
train.drop('month',axis=1,inplace=True)
valid.drop('month',axis=1,inplace=True)

#plotting the data
train['passengers'].plot()
valid['passengers'].plot()

#building the model

forecast = model.predict(n_periods=len(valid))
forecast = pd.DataFrame(forecast,index = valid.index, columns=['Prediction'])
forecast.head()
#plot the predictions for validation set
